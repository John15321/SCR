        <h1>Glock</h1>
        <p> The Glock is a series of polymer-framed, short recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-automatic pistols
            designed and produced by Austrian manufacturer Glock Ges.m.b.H. The firearm entered Austrian military and
            police service by 1982 after it was the top performer in reliability and safety tests.</p>

        <p> Despite initial resistance from the market to accept a perceived "plastic gun" due to concerns regarding
            durability and reliability which proved unfounded, as well as fears that its use of a polymer frame might
            bypass the detection of the metal detectors in airports, also unfounded, Glock pistols have become the
            company's most profitable line of products as well as supplying national armed forces, security agencies,
            and police forces in at least 48 countries. Glocks are also popular firearms among civilians for
            recreational and competition shooting, home- and self-defense, and concealed or open carry.</p>

                The company's founder, head engineer Gaston Glock, had no experience with firearms design or manufacture
                at the time their first pistol, the Glock 17, was being prototyped. Glock had extensive experience in
                advanced synthetic polymers, which was instrumental in the company's design of the first commercially
                successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced ferritic nitrocarburizing into the
                firearms industry as an anticorrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.

            <h1>
                History
            </h1>
            <p>
                In 1980, the Austrian Armed Forces announced that it would seek tenders for a new, modern duty pistol to
                replace their World War II–era Walther P38 handguns. The Austrian Ministry of Defence formulated a
                list of 17 criteria for the new generation service pistol, including requirements that it would be self
                loading; fire the NATO-standard 9×19 mm Parabellum round; the magazines were not to require any means of
                assistance for loading; be secure against accidental discharge from shock, strike, and drop from a
                height of 2 m onto a steel plate. After firing 15,000 rounds of standard ammunition, the pistol was
                to be inspected for wear. The pistol was to then be used to fire an overpressure test cartridge
                generating 5,000 bar (500 MPa; 73,000 psi).[dubious – discuss] The normal maximum operating pressure
                (Pmax) for the 9mm NATO is 2,520 bar (252 MPa; 36,500 psi).

                Glock became aware of the Austrian Army's planned procurement, and in 1982 assembled a team of Europe's
                leading handgun experts from military, police, and civilian sport-shooting circles to define the most
                desirable characteristics in a combat pistol. Within three months, Glock developed a working
                prototype that combined proven mechanisms and traits from previous pistol designs. In addition the
                plan was to make extensive use of synthetic materials and modern manufacturing technologies, to make it
                a very cost-effective candidate.

                Several samples of the 9×19mm Glock 17 (so named because it was the 17th patent procured by the
                company) were submitted for assessment trials in early 1982, and after passing all of the exhaustive
                endurance and abuse tests, the Glock emerged as the winner.

                The handgun was adopted into service with the Austrian military and police forces in 1982 as the P80
                (Pistole 80), with an initial order for 25,000 guns. The Glock 17 outperformed eight different
                pistols from five other established manufacturers (Heckler & Koch of Germany offered their P7M8, P7M13,
                and P9S, SIG Sauer of Switzerland bid with their P220 and P226 models, Beretta of Italy submitted their
                model 92SB-F, FN Herstal proposed an updated variant of the Browning Hi-Power, and the home-grown Steyr
                Mannlicher entered the competition with the GB).

                The results of the Austrian trials sparked a wave of interest in Western Europe and overseas,
                particularly in the United States, where a similar effort to select a service-wide replacement for the
                M1911 had been going on since the late 1970s (known as the Joint Service Small Arms Program). In late
                1983, the United States Department of Defense inquired about the Glock pistol and received four samples
                of the Glock 17 for unofficial evaluation. Glock was then invited to participate in the XM9 Personal
                Defense Pistol Trials, but declined because the DOD specifications would require extensive retooling of
                production equipment and providing 35 test samples in an unrealistic time frame.

                After joint Norwegian and Swedish trials in 1983–1985, in 1985 the Glock 17 was accepted into service as
                the P80 with the Norwegian and in 1988 as the Pistol 88 with the Swedish armed forces, surpassing all
                prior NATO durability standards. As a result, the Glock 17 became a standard NATO-classified
                sidearm and was granted a NATO Stock Number (1005-25-133-6775). By 1992, some 350,000 pistols had
                been sold in more than 45 countries, including 250,000 in the United States alone.

                Starting in 2013 the British Army began replacing the Browning Hi-Power pistol with the Glock 17 Gen 4,
                due to concerns about weight and the external safety of the Hi-Power. The French Armed Forces (FAF)
                in 2020 began replacing their MAC Mle 1950 and to a lesser extent their PAMAS G1 pistols with Glock 17
                Gen 5 models specifically made for the FAF. The French preferred the Glock 17 Gen 5 over the HS2000
                and CZ P-10 offerings that also made it to the final selection phase.

                A stripped lower receiver, one that is lacking the additional parts included in a completed lower
                receiver,
                is
                the only part of an AR-15 style rifle that needs to be transferred through a federally licensed firearms
                dealer
                under United States federal law.
                The lower receiver is the serial-numbered part legally defined as the firearm under United States law.
                However,
                this definition is currently questionable due to a 2019 court ruling that the AR-15 lower receiver does
                not
                match the legal definition in 27 CFR § 479.11. A completed lower receiver is visually distinguished by
                the
                trigger guard ahead of the detachable pistol grip, and behind the magazine well capable of holding
                detachable
                magazines. The lower receiver holds the trigger assembly including the hammer, and is the attachment
                point
                for
                the buttstock. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly
                for
                cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear
                take-down
                pin
                allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a hinge.
